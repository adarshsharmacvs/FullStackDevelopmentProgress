</li>
<li>
In this assingment we are taking a look at node.js which is a asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime build upon Chome's java Script engine. 
</li>
<li>
Node.js is a server side java script code. It is asynchronous and uses callback mechanism.

There are several steps needs to be followed to work with this:
</li>
<li>
Step 1) <b>Installing node js 
</b></li>

<li>
Step 2) Creating a directory and initializing npm (node package manger) : <b> init npm
</b></li>

<li>
Step 3) <b>Creating entry point may be index.js or app.js
</b></li>

<li>Now we are ready to go! <br>
We could start writing our code in <b> index.js</b> </li>

<li>We could also install dependencies using npm , I have installed a frameword express : <b>npm install express --save </b>  </li>

<li>
To run the app type in : <b>node index.js</b>
</li>
