My name is Adarsh Sharma.
I am from India.
I have 3 years of experience with Larsen & Toubro Infotech as .net Engineer.
I had previously worked with asp.net MVC and I loved working with it.
I love solving logicals issues, which requires intense RnD and logical thinking.
I would like to pursue my development career most probably as .net Developer or Java Developer because I believe both these languages are very similar and require very similar logical thinking and the way you pursue a problem.
